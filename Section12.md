After panicking for what seemed like a millenia, running through the thousands of worst case scenarios that I could run into, I finally made it to the front of the line. I was greeted by the registrar. 
	
“Hello there! Welcome to the Galacta Headquarters.” She smiled. “May I have your name?”

“Umm…” I stood blankly for a second. I wasn’t expecting a real human to be helping with the registry. I collected myself. “Wilbur Lee,” I responded. 

“W-I-L-B-U-R…” she started inputting letters into the tablet she was holding, saying out loud what she typed. “L-E-E. Is that the correct spelling, Wilbur?”

“Yes,” I responded.

“Once again, Welcome, Wilbur, to the Galacta Welfare Quarters and as an employee of Galacta.”

She installed my neural interface and I made my way back to the group.

After a facility tour, we finally ended up at the last zone, living quarters. Each of us were handed a tablet and told information about the location of our living quarters, our job assignment, and contractual obligations to get started on working. I made my way as the tablet directed me to and landed in my living quarters. It was a simple room with a bed, a table, microwave, fridge, and my bags I shipped out from home. The bare necessities to survive. There wasn’t even a TV, however those had been irrelevant since the neural interface had risen in popularity. I unpacked a few things from my bag and went to get ready to sleep.
