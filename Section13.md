I woke up and pulled myself out of bed, enthusiastic to start working immediately. I checked my tablet to see what my job assignment was and it said “Metaverse Asset Modeler” along with links to a few instructional videos for how to use the program in the metaverse. The videos thoroughly explained the program. I wouldn’t doubt even my Metaverse-abhorrent parents would be able to understand how to use the program. I logged myself into the modeling program in the Metaverse.

Ten years later, I’m still working. I do take occasional breaks but I did come here for work. It’s not amazing but it’s not terrible. I’m given food and shelter for essentially free and I get paid money for what I can use in my leisure. Though I do spend a lot of time in the metaverse, there is no real need to be anywhere other than the metaverse. I can work inside there, meet my friends there, play games, and I sometimes even just sleep in the metaverse. Sometimes it could be calming to sleep at the bottom of the ocean.
