I decided I wanted to have a comfort meal and proceeded to a small, tucked away pho shop in the corner of the cafeteria. It was a humble shop run by a single vietnamese man. He reminded me of my mother in a way, who was the hardest worker I know, and even though she was always tired, she looked out for me and wanted to make sure she was doing everything she could for me. I took a seat atop one of the 5 barstools and ordered a large chicken pho. As I prepared myself to eat as soon as my meal was prepared, a man came from behind me and ordered the exact same and occupied the seat directly next to me rather than any of the other open three. I’m not usually one to engage in conversation but since the well-dressed man took a seat next to me, I could only assume he wanted the company during his meal. “You come here often?” I asked, immediately regretting this choice of words as it was the most cliche line I could think of. The man replied not shortly after, “Yes actually, Danh here makes the best entree in this entire cafeteria, and for the best price.” As if it was rehearsed, the chef, Dahn, came over with my bowl of pho and smiled as he returned to prepare the man’s bowl. He asked “What brings you to Galacta?” To which I explained the entire situation from the offer provided and how I happened to mess up such a great opportunity. He had little to no reaction to this, but offered his apology, not that it had meant much. We kept each other company throughout our meal and talked about varying topics, most regarding technology as I happened to be extremely encaptivated by the subject, but he had fed into this and we had a great time. We sat even after we finished our meals. Assuming he had better places to be, I reached for my wallet so I could pay for my meal but before I even had the chance, the gentleman jumped the gun and paid for me. It barely came across my mind that the man and I had never introduced ourselves to one another. I saw he was returning to his life, so I spoke out to at least introduce myself, “Thanks for the meal sir, I’m Wilbur Lee by the way, may I ask who you are?” He stopped dead in his path, didn’t turn or move a single muscle. I was afraid I had triggered some sort of medical condition or thrown away all the progress we made in our conversation, but after a short pause, he reached into his wallet and reached for a business card. He threw it across the bar and it slid right under my empty pho bowl. “Get in contact with me by noon tomorrow, I have a position that I think you’d fit perfectly in.” With this line, he walked away. Completely stunned, I snapped out of it to thank him once again and I looked down at the card frantically, it read Jordan Wardle, Galacta Metaverse Developer.
	
The next morning, I woke up at 8am on the dot, and called the number on the business card. We had a great conversation and he requested that I go to his office. I got ready as fast as I could, with my best attire, I was off to the Galacta headquarters.
	
It was a short meeting I had with him, but this short meeting determined my future in this new town. He offered me a spot as his personal assistant and provided me with housing in the same building that he lives in. We came up with a plan that I could pay him back over time but while I was financially unstable, he would support me. Although I messed up, life had found a way to throw me a bone. I had a job that was better than I was offered, better than I could imagine. My dreams had come true.
