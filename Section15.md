After waking up, I brushed my teeth and sat down on my bed. I wanted to log into the metaverse just to see how it was but I’ve never actually seen how I was supposed to get into the system. I picked up the tablet they gave me and skipped over any job related documents and skipped over to the section regarding how to activate the neural interface. 

My vision was beginning to blur and turned black. “WHAT THE HELL!” I shouted. Was I going blind!?! My worries began to fade as light began to return into my vision. I was greeted by a giant “screen” in a white world. It wasn’t much of a screen as it was just a floating digital looking sign. It read “WELCOME TO THE METAVERSE”. The text changed to “Loading home world…” and a progress bar began to fill on the screen. 

Once the bar was filled, the screen popped out of existence and from miles away, a wave of colors rushed in my direction. I shut my eyes shut, bracing myself for a collision, but I felt nothing. When I opened my eyes, I was greeted by a room filled with warmth. It was like that time I went to my cousin’s cabin in the mountains. A thick cushy couch, a soft fluffy rug, and a crackling fireplace. I stepped onto the rug and felt the fibers on my toes. The detail in every little thing, it’s exactly like I was stepping inside a showroom at an IKEA. Everything felt perfect. In no way did it seem like I was in a simulation. Maybe we’ve been living in a simulation this entire time? I chuckled to myself, the Matrix is still a classic even after all of this time.

I recollected myself and set myself in front of the screen hovering over the desk. The screen was a world/program selector. There were things to add screens to our home world like OurBar to watch videos, or a web browser to check Glactachat, or even Craftmine to play some games. These were the programs that were familiar to me. While my parents were against the metaverse and neural interfaces, they played games in their childhood so we did have a PC in our home. I looked over to the other section of the selection menu on the screen and that was all of the neural interface exclusive programs. I decided to close my eyes and hit a random button.
___
I ended up playing games in the metaverse until night. It was actually quite interesting. All of the models in the game were super life-like. Finally, after spending a day to see what the metaverse is and trying out things with the neural interface, I finally took a look at my job assignment. The email on my tablet read “Metaverse Asset Modeler”. So I’ll be making models like I just saw earlier today!?! Thinking about what I might be able to make got me a bit excited. After knowing what I might eventually be capable of I decided to head to sleep for the night and started thinking about ideas for things I could make tomorrow. 
___
My first assignment was to just start familiarizing myself with the program. Through the neural interface, there was an application that simply showed what I was modeling while I had to put all the pieces together using a combination of tools in a 2D screen and within the 3D environment. I slowly took my time to learn how to use these tools. While not too difficult, it still amazes me that people could make such detailed models from this program. The most I’ve come up with so far is just a simple donut that didn’t really seem particularly realistic, unlike many of the foods I’ve already seen in the metaverse that had perfect photo-realism as well as extremely accurate to life texture, tastes, and all that jazz. 
___
I finally got to do my first real project, it was a farming combine. I was quite familiar with these since it was something I used everyday working on the soybean farm back home. I pulled out some reference images and went down my memory bank…
___
After about 5 days of work I managed to complete the combine and it actually looked quite good. I submitted my model and a prompt said that I was gonna be receiving my pay through direct deposit and once that went through there would be additional benefits sent to my metaverse account. 

I waited a few hours to make sure that it would process and took a look at my bank account. All I received was enough to cover minimum wage for 2 work days worth of pay. That was barely enough. While Galacta does provide us with free housing for working for them, we still had to pay for food. I checked my metaverse account to see what “benefits” I had received. I saw that my account had 1000 Galactabills in it. So the “benefits” was just currency that they could artificially create on their own and had no real monetary value outside of the metaverse? I spend all my time working for them to create an amazing model and this is all they give me? 

I shook that thought out of my head. Maybe if I just manage to get good enough at this job I’ll be able to earn more. 

I reinvested the Galactabills that I got into my work. I was able to buy the upgraded version of the modeling program, though honestly I don’t know why they didn’t just give it to us in the first place, and bought some reference models that I could use for future projects. I took a look at my next assignment and it was a guillotine, which I’ve never seen in my life. Well… time to get to work…
___	
I managed to do the research for the guillotine, figuring out the mechanisms and the material textures so I could translate them perfectly to the metaverse, and build the model within 3 days. I sent the model in and received my payment once again. It was, this time, 1 day’s worth of wage and 450 galactabills. Makes sense as it’s a smaller model. What’s next?
___
3 months have passed since I’ve started working, and I’m still not getting that much pay. I’ve been working fairly fast but the Galactabills are basically useless to me in any way that’s not related to work. I barely have time to actually enjoy myself and use them for my own enjoyment with how little I’m actually paid. Ever since the combine, I’ve only been getting weird objects assigned to me, which is now starting to bore me. I don’t get paid enough and I’m not being able to do things that interest me. I came to the facility because I thought that having access to the metaverse would give me some freedom away from the farms but it’s just more suffocating than before. 
___
I decided that I wouldn’t take this anymore. My parents' warnings were correct. Galacta wasn’t to be trusted for my living. I quickly signed some resignation papers and got ready to leave quickly. Because the free neural link was part of the benefits of working, I had to get it removed before I left and returned home. 

After I finally made it back home, I breathed in the fresh air. I was away from the stuffy rooms in the center. I took a look at the combine sitting in our fields and the one I made was almost perfect.
