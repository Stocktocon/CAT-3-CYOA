I decide to explore more of the city, my home for the rest of my professional life- I wouldn’t want my first minutes in the city to be just doing paperwork. I peel away from the group, looking for landmarks that might direct me, but as I duck to the side of the extremely wide road I realize that all the buildings except for the headquarters look almost identical - massive gray and white cuboids with no windows. The street level entrances have no signs, instead featuring only small tracking codes on matte plastic panels. I figured I should ask someone for directions, so tapped a man on the shoulder “Excuse me, would you know the directions to housing district 5e?”. No reaction. I ask again. Nothing. I try shoving his shoulder, but he steps away before I can, without even glancing in my direction. It's starting to get dark, and the city has almost no artificial lighting. Getting hungry, I try going to a food vendor, where dozens of people walk up and pick up boxes that get automatically dispensed from the wall. Remembering that I have a food voucher chip that guarantees dining for a month before employment, I get into the uncannily fast line. I try scanning my chip on the wall but nothing happens. I walk off, giving the wall a solid kick. By now it is almost pitch black, but despite the darkness the crowd of vehicles and people is still as dense and overwhelming as ever. Perhaps trying to get a sense of the city before getting signed into the metaverse was a mistake- the problem now is I haven't got the slightest clue where the headquarter is. I feel like I have been walking aimlessly in the dark for hours, as people and vehicles just barely miss crashing into me. Defeated, I sit down on the sidewalk. 

Someone lights a match beside me. “First day in the city, boy?” says the old man lighting a pipe. “It’s not too bad here you know, you can sleep in the middle of the road and no one will lay a finger on ya” he chuckles. It must have been the first human voice you’ve heard in a day. “Who are you?” I mutter. “Just some old cat who wanted to take a look at the new toys. It’s rare to see young natural fools on the streets nowadays” the old man remarks. “Natural what?” I ask. “Ah, you know, those who can’t be using the net galacta set up because the tech doesn’t work on their brains. Heh, guess you're just a regular old fool for walking around without logging in.” the man laughed. “Shut it. What's going on here anyway, isn’t there a place where a guy can get some food?“ Wading through the darkness, the old man leads me to the outskirts of the city where the noise of the crowd gave way. Rounding the corner, the light of a neon sign sears my eyes, the hazy light illuminating the dank alleyway. Interface Incompatible Support Center, it read, although it looked more like a rat's nest than a welfare facility. There must’ve been a crowd of 30, all chatting. “Welcome to the fools club. This place has got everything a man needs. Go fix yourself up.”, the old man says, sitting himself down next to a group dressed in teal. I make your way across the slightly sticky deck towards a man laidling tomato borscht. I hand him my food voucher chip. He gives me a look and laughs, “We don’t use that around here, help yourself”. Taking a bowl of steamy soup, I sit down by the teal group, and they look at me. “So you're the kid who decided to see the world for what it is, I like the cut of your jib”, one of the teal men says. “Y’know kid, you and we are probably the only people here who can actually connect to the metaverse. Everyone else here is busted in the head and would probably die if they tried to log in.” You ask them why they are here at such an odd hour, and not at their assigned living quarters. “ It’s the only place in this city with good dim sum! The augmented crap just doesn’t hit the spot.” The group then explained that they used to be metaverse developers, who after a decade of career climbing, decided to quit. “Y’know, I hardly remember what they had me work on for the first 5 years, I think it was tin foil simulation or something.” They explained how they took a year to wean themselves off metaverse dependency, and how they got involved with the interface incompatible community, and how they were developing a less invasive and addictive interface they call the sheaf. “The people who rely on this center, their lives are difficult, but they are happy here.” “Can’t say that about most galacta employees”, one of them snarks. “They helped us a lot in the development of the sheaf. We’ve been trying to share our interface to those addicted to the metaverse, but no one seems to be interested. We could really use more people like you. “ 

Soon, I found myself getting to know everyone in the center. I thanked the leader of the support center, who was also the kitchen manager, and helped peel carrots. I talked to people who worked as janitors, and fulfillment center workers. They all seemed to work and live alone, and many of them were unregistered. One of them had a health scare, and not even a family member who worked in health services knew of a way of getting them care. After a long night of talking, an escort bot came bumbling in through the door. “Wilbur Lee, Report Immediately, Wilbur Lee …” it blared. It took a minute before I was aware of its presence. “Please report to the Galacta Headquarters immediately to begin onboarding. Failure to report within the day will void your guaranteed employment and housing rights …”. 

I follow the escort robot out of the center, back into the noise of the city, as the sun begins to rise. Returning to the Galacta Headquarters, I notice how different it looks bathed in the red glow, and get into the long line for onboarding. Standing in the line, which coils around the lobby, I think about my future - what kind of job will I be assigned, will I be compatible with the interface, what online community will I be most involved with - but standing in the almost stationary line, I can’t shake the feeling that you would rather be at the support center. Finally, I reach the registrar where I submit my personal information, and have my interface installed- which felt no worse than a single prick of a tattoo needle at the base of my neck. Putting on my augmentation glasses, I am struck with a deep nausea that almost sends me to my knees, which the registrar explains is a typical response. I am then given my onboarding seminar schedule - within a month I am to choose which career branch I will enter. Trying to take it all in, I step out of the headquarters - and everything is different. The buildings which used to look plain, were now surrounded by bright, animated, 3d signs and advertising. The street which used to be filled with a dense crowd, now was almost empty except for a couple of fellow immigrants- the interface must’ve filtered everyone else out. Walking around is nauseating, I can almost feel yourself moving in strange ways unconsciously to avoid the invisible traffic, but slowly over time the interface filters out that feeling too. I join a group of fellow immigrants, who are going to get food. The food vendors display a wide range of options. Feeling a craving for fried noodles, I step up to the booth, and a lunch box is automatically dispensed. The teal people were right, metaverse augmented food just isn’t that convincing. You think for a second about going back to the fools club for a bite, but remember your first onboarding seminar begins soon.

After a week of onboarding, I have settled down and learned a bit more about life in the metaverse, and explored many virtual experiences. Most who live in the city are employed by the Galacta corporation, or employed by subcontractors. I have been pretty busy with onboarding classes, but I found the time to visit the support center. I try to remember the path the old man knew, but as I reach the alleyway, It is sealed off by an infinitely tall gray wall, the border of the augmented city- it’s too far from the city to be properly scanned in. The only way I can proceed is If I disconnect myself. Ignoring all the warnings, I remove my augmentation glasses. The searing pain is unbearable, and my vision is distorted beyond recognition- there is no way I can get to the center, let alone talk to anyone. Working through the pain, I get the glasses back on my head, and my senses slowly stabilize. Lifting myself off the ground with a sigh, I realize that I will probably be living in Galacta’s walled garden for the rest of my life. As I turn around to head back, someone taps me on the shoulder- it’s one of the teal people. “When did I let you into my realm?” I ask, shocked. “The security on this stuff is awful, I just let myself in” the man responded. “The name’s Wilson by the way, and I warned you, the interfaces they give out turn your brain into goop. I swear, if people used the sheaf, it would be better for everyone.”

A year has passed, and I have secured an entry job as a data entrist at a fulfillment center, where I scan in 3d objects to create augmented reality models. The job is monotonous, but I know it is important for the functioning of the fulfillment center -plus I’m due for a promotion in a week. “It’s important that you scan it in from multiple angles, and with a wide range of wavelengths' ' I explain to a coworker I am training. “If we scan in objects wrong we can potentially injure people who try to interact with them. Our job is to make sure that everything inside the metaverse is well documented and accessible- especially for those with disabilities.” “Wait, what do you mean by disabilities? “ asks the coworker. “Those with neuromuscular disorders, or sensory impairments, have different considerations and rely more on us doing things right.” I respond. “Yeah I get what you mean, but those things aren’t really disabilities. Hell, were all basically blind at night time right? And augmented body avatars means that we’re all the same physically. I don’t see why we should bring disabilities into this. Like, do disabilities even really exist anymore?” he retorts. “I suppose in a sense, certain disabilities are minimized by interface technology, if we do our jobs right, but it's important to know that some choose not to use the interface fully,” I reply. “What? Why wouldn’t they choose to use the thing that would fix all their problems? They got to be stupid right, like mentally ill”, he asks, shocked. “Not necessarily. Interface technology doesn’t always work for everyone. It can be disorienting, or even harmful to some.” I say. “Ok, I guess? But if they can’t even connect to the metaverse, what are they even doing living here.” he responds. “They’re here for the same reason they were here- it’s one of the few places with opportunity. A lot of them come here to be with their family, or to give their children a better future.” I replied. “Huh. I guess it's weird that I have never seen them before in my life” he says. “Well that's just it, unless we’re in their communities, there's no way of meeting them. I recommend you join the interface incompatible community, it’s pretty small but I’m pretty active there”. We got pretty sidetracked from the training process, but it was nice to vent about something no one usually cares about. I decided to clip that memory and share it with the community. Almost instantly, the clip has more engagement than most of your posts, and there is a lot of discussion.

It’s the next day, and the post has gone positively viral, and is being shared in the largest communities. I capitalize immediately, posting tons of clips going more into the stories of those rendered invisible by interface incompatibility. The clips are becoming more popular, and donations are starting to come in. I think I have a shot at becoming a full time disability activist.
