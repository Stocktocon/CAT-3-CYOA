I’m not too sure how long I had been sitting there with my head in the clouds but it must’ve been the third time the registrar tried to get my attention because her voice was raised and she was visibly irritated. In order to avoid inconveniencing her any further, I rushed over to get my neural interface installed and proceed past her.
	
I entered a great indoor courtyard. All around me, I could see levels upon levels of balconies and pathways splitting into different directions. This sight was almost as astonishing as that of the city’s skyline on the bus here. Almost allowing my small attention span to get the better of me once again, I decided I should try to reconvene with the group once again. Looking around, this job would be nowhere near easy. The first floor was flooded with groups with varying levels of professionalism. On one end of the spectrum, there was touring groups of what seemed to be fans of the company who matched my excitement regarding this technology, and on the other end, there were groups of people in lab coats and professional attire, the people you know make the job get done, the people you know are capable of transforming the structure of an entire city to fit their liking. It was people like this that I looked up to.

It just so happened that at this very moment, I was looking directly at them as they were rushing in my direction with no intention of moving around me. After I quickly dodged the group of employees, I remembered my task at hand which was to look around for my original group.

After about 15 minutes of searching, my efforts seemed useless, and I gave into my primal instincts and searched for the nearest shop to buy food at as I hadn’t had anything to eat since the beginning of my last bus ride. During my search for my group, I had passed by a cafeteria so I decided to retrace my steps and I was there in no time. The amount of options that were presented before me was overwhelming. There were classics such as American food being served in a buffet style portion of the cafeteria, foreign and new foods to me that were served out of various stands and restaurants, and even higher levels with fancier looking options where I could only assume important lunches were held and important people ate. 

After exploring my options, I decided to eat at:
