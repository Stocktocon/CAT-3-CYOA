I and the group of new immigrants huddle close to the escort bot, trying not to get run over, as we make our way to the registrar where our neural interface would be installed. My parents remembered when Galacta first unveiled proxy accretor technology - the first commercial grade neural interface and portal into the metaverse- which they usually describe with hushed voices. They would tell tales of those who would spasm and tear themselves into pieces when connecting to the network, or those who would step away from their families and lives. But technology has improved a lot since then- implants have become far less invasive, and simulated experiences more vividly.
	
Eventually, our group had made it to the job assignment area, but the line was as long as the Golden Gate Bridge, which I had seen on my flight here. “Oh god…” I internalized, “I hope there’s going to be jobs left for me by the time I get to the front of the line. What if all of the good jobs get taken before I arrive!?!”
