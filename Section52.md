My posts are gaining more traction, and I am starting to be recognised in more and more communities as a leading interface incompatibility activist. The interface incompatibility community is growing, and you are hearing more and more about how your posts inspired people to spend more time helping those with interface incompatibility in their lives. Donations are coming in steadily, enough to form a media team to help make more and better content every day- everything is going so much better than expected. I talked to Wilson one day, and were talking about interface technology. “Y’know, Galacta’s interface is just so too dependent on galacta scanning services, but I think we just cracked the code. The sheaf can augment spaces automatically and seamlessly, and it works for people who are usually interface-incompatible. People are getting more and more discontent with the galacta interface and ecosystem. I think if you promoted us, that could be the push we need to get our name out there.” Wilson boasts. “ We don’t really do product placement. Plus, I don’t even want to try the sheaf myself. You’d probably harvest my brain data and sell an AI clone of me on the black market.” you respond. 

“Hmm, I guess you know me a bit too well.” Wilson sighs, “I’ll spill the beans I guess. I’ve been following your online activism from the start, and you know how your first dozen posts had no views? That’s because galacta shadow bans most accounts that promote dissenting content. But we knew we needed people like you to spread the word for the sheaf to succeed, so I tried something. Who knew a couple bot accounts and gadget tricks were enough to disable the shadow ban for an account? I was surprised too when I saw that post blow up” Wilson explains. I take a second to parse everything he’s saying. “Ok, I’ll explain it simply. Either you promote the sheaf on your socials, or we re-enable the shadow ban and your community will disappear.” I feel sick just hearing it, knowing that Wilson was behind the scenes . “I’m sorry we had to take such a firm stance. It’s just that we have been working on the sheaf for a decade and really think it would help people.”

It’s been a couple of days, and I informed the whole team about what Wilson told me. I start recording. “There’s something you can do to help the interface-incompatible. The people at sheaf are working on new interface technology that allows everyone to enter the metaverse and help make it a safer place. If you install the sheaf interface extension, you can help scan in the environment even in undocumented locations! … “ 

A year has passed, and the sheaf interface has all but replaced the galacta interface for augmented reality, and sheaf is one of the largest publicly traded companies. I have long quit online activism, as it took a major toll on my mental health, and am now coasting on the shares of sheaf I own. I decide to visit what used to be the interface incompatible support center, which has now been scanned in by the sheaf crowdsource. The ex-leader and kitchen manager came and greeted me, “Wilbur, long time no see. Things around here have changed a lot since we last met.” “Yeah, I guess so. Two har gow please. Where is everyone?” I replied. “Oh long gone. When people started to use the sheaf, they would come to the center to gawk at us, some of them left then. But when the sheaf tech started working for us, a lot of us left to get jobs. Some of them still come by now and then, but they're always super busy. The ones for which the new tech still didn’t work went to the newer support centers, like the one you founded. I guess I have to thank you for everything though.” It feels odd how quiet this place is now.
