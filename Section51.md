It would be foolish to expect you could build a career to support yourself off of online activism, everyone has their five minutes of fame. Knowing it would take a whole team to produce content fast enough to grow a community, I am content with helping the interface-incompatible when I can. 

Four years have passed, and I have climbed and  became the manager of the fulfillment center. Although my day to day is mundane, filled with long meetings with business colleagues, and long afternoons alone, or numbing myself with virtual experiences and entertainment, I try to keep those around me mindful of the people rendered invisible by the world. Iâ€™m not much of a philanthropist- our fulfillment center is just barely scraping by- but I stay connected with the interface incompatible support center, and try to provide job opportunities when I can.
